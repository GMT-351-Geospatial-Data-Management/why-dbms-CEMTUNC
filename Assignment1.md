The most effective advantage of DBMS is detail search than other programming. We can organize categories data with all software, but not investigate to information to automatic. Because of, in search tool of other software what is not sql (Structured Query Language), branches in data are not connect with each other. Other advantages are managed to big data, spend too little time, carry out to work easily, storage data regularly, etc.


In Map Sector, developing huge companies benefit from database management system.
To give examples of included sql software in programming: 


1_ Artificial intelligences 
High Technology cars can arrive to automatic entering address. It focuses on the address in all information. Artificial intelligence make decision to go which ways and eliminates to intense roads in whole tracks. We recognized system chose and eliminate. There always is a query.
Query system can detection information with cameras and coding who happy, sad, careless or willing on the making work in office.

City-->county-->neighbourhood-->island number-->parcel number
Ex: This parcel area information is significant at cadastre updating (Kadastro GÃ¼ncelleme) work.
Owner deed (https://webtapu.tkgm.gov.tr/giris)
Netcad, ArcGIS, MicroStation, â€¦
Ex: In the Expropriation (KamulaÅŸtÄ±rma), We have big data about owner information (name, surname, identity number, tel number, address, parcel location, share on the area, right of easementâ€¦) and parcels that we arranged and matched with coding.
